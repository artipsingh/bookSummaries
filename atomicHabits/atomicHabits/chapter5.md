The best way to formulate a new habit happens when you find a place for when and where to act.

Formulation of a plan that includes **When** and **Where** the new action that you would like to perform will happen increases the odds that you will follow through on the new habit.

## Implementation Intention
Formulate a plan for when and where an action will take place.
The Implementation Intention work by leveraging the queues of :
  * Time
  * Location

Implementation intentions increase the possibility that you will follow through on the new habits, and it forms a more concrete purpose on the plan when you follow the implementation plan

I will do .........(behaviour) at ........ (time) at .......(place)

Setting an implementation intention helps you to do the right thing at the time that you intend to do it

## Habit Stacking

To build a new habit, use the connectedness of habits to your advantage.

> Identify the current habit or behaviour that you can do each day and add your new habit onto that behaviour

After _current habit_, I will do _new habit_ .

>The key to do this correctly is to tie the desired behaviour to something you already do every day.
> To be successful, you must tie a place and a time.
>When a new habit is bound to an existing habit, this specific trigger makes it easier for you to act on your new habit.
