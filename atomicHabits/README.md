# Atomic Habits
Summary of chapters 1, 2, 5 of Atomic Habits by James Clear


Every time we perform a habit, we execute a four-step pattern: cue, craving, response, reward.
If we want to form new habits, we should make them **obvious**, **attractive**, **easy**, and **satisfying**.

## Habit forming loop
> Cue - There is a reward somewhere to be found
> Craving - The motivation to change something to get the reward
> Response - Thought or action you need to take to get to the reward.
> Reward - The satisfying feeling you get from the change
