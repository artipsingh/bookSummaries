Continuous Delivery

Test Automation
Automate:
Once you have run a test a couple of times
When you are confident that all of your time will not be spent maintaining the tests
Alternate between happy and sad tests
Happy path test are the first tests that you should start with when automating

When To Automate
Start Of Project
Automate at the start of the project, the cost of automation is low
Create processes that can lead to the creation of more automated tests
Decide on good processes and put acceptance tests into the definition of done
Work to get customer + development team buy in
Automated tests will often change the way that the code is written

Mid Project
Start with the important + high value parts of the application
Automate the happy path
Work with the high value parts of the application
Make the tests cover a broader level of functionality
Maximize the number of scenarios at the story level
